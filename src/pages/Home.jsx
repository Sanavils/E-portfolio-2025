          <p className='overview'>Design is a continuous movement, a line unfolding into infinite possibilities. Each project begins with a singular idea, expanding into multiple directions, testing boundaries, and evolving through exploration. Yet, no matter how far the journey takes it, everything converges back into a seamless experience—clear, intentional, and impactful. My approach follows this principle: structured yet free, bold yet refined. Every interface, every interaction, every experience I create is a reflection of this philosophy.</p>
